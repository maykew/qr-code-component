## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Reset CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I tried to practice the concept of HTML5 semantic structuring, aiming to make the content clearer both for programmers and for browsers and other engines that process this information.

```html
<body>
	<main>
		<section>
			<header>
				<h1>Title</h1>
				<img>
			</header>
			<p>Contents</p>
		</section>
	</main>

	<footer>
		<p>Description</p>
	</footer>
</body>
```

Also, I first used the "[Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)". The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.

### Continued development

I intend to develop more pages using only HTML and CSS to consolidate the concepts of "HTML5 Semantic" and "Flexbox".

### Useful resources

- [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner;
- [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on;
